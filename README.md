# E-Commerce-Transactions

## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for a Data Science assignment involving an **eCommerce Transactions Dataset**. The dataset contains customer, product, and transaction details, and the goal is to derive actionable insights, build predictive models, and perform clustering to segment customers.

The assignment consists of three main tasks:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Gain insights from the dataset and generate actionable business insights.
2. **Lookalike Model** - Build a recommendation system to find similar customers based on their profiles and transaction history.
3. **Customer Segmentation** - Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques and visualize the results.
